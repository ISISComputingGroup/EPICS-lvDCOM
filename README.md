An EPICS support module to access items on the front panel of the <A HREF="http://www.ni.com/labview/"> National Instruments LabVIEW software package</A> and expose them as EPICS process variables. It uses Microsoft Windows DCOM technology and thus both the EPICS IOC and LabVIEW software must be running on Microsoft Windows. In most cases modification of the original LabVIEW is not required to use this package. For an alternative option that additionally works on Linux, you could create network shared variables within LabVIEW and then use the <A HREF="https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/EPICS-NetShrVar/">NetShrVar</A> package.
